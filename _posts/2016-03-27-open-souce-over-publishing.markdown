In 2004 Google published the [MapReduce paper][mapReduce-paper] but didn't release any open source implementation for it. As is the case with any popular paper, others did create open source implementations; most notably, Yahooâ€™s Hadoop. Hadoop went on to create an entire industry and left Google incompatible with the rest of the world as Google continued to itâ€™s own technology. 

Itâ€™s obviously ironic that Google is incompatible with a standard it created. However, in hindsight itâ€™s obvious that this would have happened. Clearly itâ€™s something Iâ€™ll be thinking about next time Iâ€™m about to publish ðŸ˜›. 

On the topic of publishing, this effect is something that [Prof. Forsyth][daf] has often suggested at our research meetings. He often recommends us to not worry about the perfect implementation but rather, to focus on the idea and its soundness. His argument has always been that weâ€™ll find a hundred people willing to implement it for us so long as we have a good idea.
