Imagine applications that crash multiple times every second but still work just fine. This may sound like a magical scenario but you're probably actually quite familiar with this. In fact, there's an entire programming philosophy called ['let it crash' programming][let-it-crash] And as I found out today, Erlang has [Supervisor Trees][st-docs] that help handle this magic.

_Note: I'm not very familiar with distributed computing or with Erlang. This is my first real dive into this stuff. Please let me know about errors in my write-up when you see them â™¥._

In regards to being familiar with crashing being fine - think of any REST API. Perhaps an issue with a specific API call causes a crash. Surely this shouldn't take down your server; there are other clients that need to make calls. Now of course servers don't crash this easily as they implement some reasonable recovery mechanism. 

Erlang's Supervisor Tree is essentially a slick implementation of such a recovery mechanism. Think of it as an exceptions implementation that works asynchronously - asynchronous exceptions. The processes in your app are monitored for failures and the relevant processes are restarted in a safe way to make sure you app doesn't crash.

This is definitely seeming interesting enough to warrant a deeper dive. Perhaps I'll revisit it for a weekly post :)
