### Welcome to [hackermode][hackermode] :D
This is one of the blogs for the [developermode project][dev]. In addition to the standard devlopermode expectations, you can expect at least one post daily. This daily post is going to be about something that surprised me on that day. It's usually going to be something about CS, but not always. Sometimes I'm surprised by non CS things as well :P.

### About Me
